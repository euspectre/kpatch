kpatch is a Linux dynamic kernel patching infrastructure which allows you to
patch a running kernel without rebooting or restarting any processes.  It
enables sysadmins to apply critical security patches to the kernel immediately,
without having to wait for long-running tasks to complete, for users to log
off, or for scheduled reboot windows.  It gives more control over uptime
without sacrificing security or stability.

This variant of kpatch is based on `https://github.com/dynup/kpatch` and has
Virtuozzo-specific additions and tweaks.
